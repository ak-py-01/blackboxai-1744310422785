# SM ERP

## Project Overview
SM ERP is a simple ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) application designed to manage various business processes through a user-friendly interface. This application utilizes Docker for container management, allowing smooth setup and deployment of its services. The backend is built with Python and uses PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Installation
To get started with SM ERP, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd sm_erp
   ```

2. **Build and run the application** using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**: 
   After the services are up, you can access the backend service on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and PostgreSQL database on [localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the ERP system via HTTP requests. Utilize tools such as Postman or curl to send requests to your backend service. The API endpoints should be defined in the backend code (not provided in the files).

## Features
- User management and authentication
- Comprehensive data management (CRUD operations)
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Dockerized application for easy deployment and scalability
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data

## Dependencies
While detailed package.json contents are not provided, a typical backend setup with Node.js or Python might include the following dependencies:
- An ORM like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM
- A web framework such as Flask or FastAPI
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

Please check the `package.json` file in the project root for specific dependencies to install.

### Notes
- Ensure to update the `SECRET_KEY` in the `docker-compose.yml` with your own secure key.
- Make sure your application code inside the `app` directory correctly connects to the PostgreSQL database as configured.
